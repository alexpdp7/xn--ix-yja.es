# Blueprint

These documents are in English to make them more widely useful.

These documents intend to document how to set up self-hosted services in a reusable manner.

* [Hosting](hosting.org): hosting providers.
* [Setup](setup.md): An example installation process using Gandi and Contabo.

## Services

* RSS
  * [Feed reader](feed-reader.md)
  * Planet
* Code forge: Forgejo seems to just work
* Communication
  * [Mailing list](mailing-list.md)
  * [Instant messaging](instant-messaging.md)
  * Others (forums, ActivityPub, ...)

## TODO

* Backups (see <https://doc.yunohost.org/en/backup/backup_methods>; Borg, Restic)
* Monitoring?
* YunoHost application backups or full VPS backups?

## Other references
